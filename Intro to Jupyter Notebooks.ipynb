    "On *Navigating Complexity* keep \"a lab notebook\". It serves as a journal, notebook, sketchbook, diary, and more. Your notes are your own, and freeform. To keep these notes along the course, we use [*Jupyter Notebooks*](http://jupyter.org/). There are five submissions during the course, on weeks 7, 10 and 13 you will submit your lab notebook. Also some of the course content, e.g. Thursday exercises and extra content are in this format.\n",

    "Jupyter Notebooks are a document format and what makes them special, is that parts of the document are meant for humans, and parts for computers. For the latter, we use the Python programming language.\n",

    "Notebooks are structured much like a text, running from beginning to the end. The prose can be interleaved with code, and computed output."
